        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://arngren.net/">Bad site example: Arngren</a></h3>
        <p>Argren is a yellow pages style site that uses a collage of images and blue hyper links to display various products for sale, the site features a table for the different catogories hosted on the site along with images and titles for the products hosted onto its main page.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast is generally used very poorly, the site has various colors for titles and links the mixture of colors and fonts do not help with readability.</li>
            <li>This site uses inconsistent formatting, colors, and layouts. Overall very poor repetition with every page feeling disconnected from even its own self and lacking a cohesive experience.</li>
            <li>Argren uses a very disorderly manner to display information creating an unorganized site for the user, visually the site is very busy and unorganized making it hard for a user to understand a clear layout or goal of the site.</li>
            <li>The site listed uses very poor proximity, no products are listed together and there is no consistent order.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a href="https://www.lacoste.com/us/lacoste-heritage.html">Good site example: Lacoste-Heritge</a></h3>
        <p>Lacoste is a high end luxury clothing brand with historical roots dating to the 1900s and this pages focuses on that history, all the way from its founders to the various aways the company has earned in its sporting roots to the modern age and how the company continues its legacy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This site uses great colors and fonts that are freindly to the eye that create a very readable page.</li>
            <li>Lacoste uses great spacing on its paragraphs along with its use of its colors and font lead to a great visually appealing layout.</li>
            <li>All elements within the page such as paragraphs and photos are arranged very well guiding the user throughout the page.</li>
            <li>On this site the proximity of all its features are done very well with a great connectiom from paragraphs to images as well as dynamic images as the user scrolls.</li>
        </ul>
